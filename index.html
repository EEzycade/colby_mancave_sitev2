      <h2>Welcome to The Mancave!</h2>
      <p>Hello and and welcome to Mancave Collection! This website is a portfolio of my impressive mancave, as it's something I'm proud of that I want to share with the world. My name is Colby Ellsworth, and I've had a mancave in my parent's house since I was 9 years old. This room was converted from a section of the garage into a great functioning mancave, and I've filled the room with impressive collections, a TV, a mini fridge, and that's just touching the surface. I inherited a very large collection of Legos, and the mancave provided a place to store and display them as well as a video game collection. This mancave has been incredibly fun and useful to me for years, and it has gone through many changes to make it a truly one-of-a-kind place.</p>
      <p>On this website, you will find:</p>
      <ul>
        <li class="line">Many images and a video to show the Mancave's features in 
         detail</li>
        <li class="line">The Room Page, which shows the purpose and features of the room
        </li>
        <li class="line">The Collection Page, which shows information about the 
         collections</li>
        <li class="line">The Contact Page, which allows you to contact me to ask  
         questions</li>
        <li>Timeline pages, which show the changes made to the room over time</li>
      </ul>
      <p>I hope you are impressed with this showcase of the Mancave. This room has been a fun project for years and I have very much enjoyed making memories with friends and family in the Mancave. Please explore the site and enjoy the Mancave Collection!</p>

      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>Hello, I'm Colby Ellsworth, the creator of this site. I live in Mesa, Arizona, and I'm a 20-year-old student at Mesa Community College. I have three brothers (one of which is my twin), two sisters, and five nieces and nephews, so being with family is a lot of fun! I am also physically disabled and I drive a power wheelchair, which can be fun to drive. I have always loved Legos and video games, especially since my older brothers collected both, and the collections got so big that we needed a place to store them. Some of my other interests and hobbies include computers, reading, Star Wars, and spending time with friends and family. I am proud of the fun place the Mancave is, and hope to keep it around for years to come!</p>
